                        "There is nothing pretty much to say about me. I am just a normal girl <em>(or should I say middle aged women
                        since I am in my 30's which all the time makes me cry as I am moving closer and closer 
                        to getting old)</em>. But Hey! People say Age is just a number right? Atleast there are some saying 
                        that makes me feel good about aging too! Anyways I am off the track now. So About me.Ummmm As I said 
                        I am just a normal girl who doesnt takes anything the life throws at me in a stride.<em>(atleast I think so).</em>
                        I am happy even for the small things that happens day in and day out. I am a person who thinks there is no
                        point in getting sad over something that we dont have any control. True right!! What else can you do.
                        Either we should be in a position to do something else if we cant do anything,,,, then whats the point
                        in thinking too much about it. So thats me in a nutshell. "

                    <p>
                        "I love my family!!! <em>(But then, who doesnt)</em>.. These are the people who will stand by 
                        you when you feel you are alone in this world. I have a loving husband, a wonderful 8 year old son.
                        <em>(But you wont realize I am so wonderful when I yell at him, which is almost everyday atleast 5 to 10 times)</em>. But Hey
                        who can complain about me. Y'all know boys right? Somedays he drives me simple crazy. But then I wouldnt trade
                        him for anyone else in the world. Next comes my husband. He is the total opposite of me. But then opposites
                        attract right!!!! I talk a lot, he seldom talks. I have lot of friends, he has handful of confidente's. I talk on 
                        phone for hours and hours he hates talking in the phone. Even now after 10 years of our marriage we still wonder how in heaven we got married. Ours
                        was not at all a love marriage. It was purely arranged by both our parents and I saw him only a day before 
                        our parents had planned for our engagement. This is how it happens in India. My mom was a pure terror if she hears the word 'LOVE'.
                        I was scared just because of facing my parents. So just thought that a Love marriage was not my cup of tea.
                        So yeah coming back to my story, I met my husband a day before our engagement day. He didnt know what to talk.
                        Even now he doesnt know what to talk because now I do all the talking..He used to say he never ever realized
                        I will talk this much else he would have reconsidered marrying me. But hey, I was/am a good girl. I dont talk
                        to strangers that much.. Now comes my parents!!! I still am my dad's princess... It doesnt matter how old
                        I am, he will always have my back.. My husband still says that he can never complain about me to my dad and 
                        he doesnt have any ally in my side of the family. If he did say something to my dad(I think he has done it before thats y he is able 
                        to say this), my dad will tell him his little girl (thats me) might not have meant that or done that etc.
                        See thats what I am talking about my dad always has my back. Be it for my husband. Somedays I tell my husband 
                        to learn that from my dad..(My life is settled then!!!). My mom is awesome. She is more stricter than my dad,
                        atleast to me.. My brother was always her pet project. But now when I am a mom with a son, I know how she feels about
                        my brother."

                        "I love Reading books.. Just give me a book, you wont hear anything from me. I love 
                        reading fiction books. My favorite authors are Sandra Brown, Linda Howard, Diana Palmer, Nora Roberts etc.
                        Romantic novels are the common genre for all these authors. I love reading happily ever after stories.
                        But hey anything that makes you happy is good for you right??? I read suspence thrillers also. 
                        You can call me a feminist, but I love reading female authors more than male authors. I love cooking too 
                        but I will not say it a passion. Its just that I am sometimes simply lazy to get up and cook. "

                        " I absolutely hate cleaning the house, folding cothes.. Ughhhhhhh Thats is something
                        I am royally pissed todo.. I somehow feel folding clothes are not at all productive when you
                        will take the same cloth to wear again in couple of days.. Then whats the point in folding it. 
                        getting my point??? See sometimes I really do make sense. So in my house its my husbands work 
                        in folding all the laundered clothes and you know what!!! He LOVES folding clothes.. WHAT ARE THE ODDS!!!!
                        Anyways as long as it is out of my bucket list of house chores I am happy. You know what
                        I am training my son these days to do laundry not jus his ours too.. I need a backup for my 
                        husband. So if sometime he cant do it, it doesnt fall on my head to do.. Catching my point??"

                    <p>
                        "I am from India. Typically South India. From a city called Chennai and from state TamilNadu. I love 
                        my place. I really do miss my place. Its something in your blood.. Wherever your life takes you, you will
                        still crave for your roots. Thats how it is for me and my husband too.. My son doesnt know any better.
                        We moved here when he was nearly 4years. So he doesnt really remember his Chennai days. There was lot of 
                        help back in my place. Both my parents and in-laws where there in Chennai. And know what I didnt have to cook....
                        Because if I drop in at any of the 2 houses at any meal time, I would be getting food.. OMG how I really miss it.. 
                        Here, if I dont cook, we three go hungry... Essentially, I learnt to cook once we koved here.. Other than 
                        that there were all sorts of assorted aunts and uncles. So there was never a festival that went without 
                        visiting all out relatives place. It was fun. I do miss my INDIA. "
